  		  		<b>Murderer on the Loose:</b><br/> Mysterious Death of John McFarmer Still Unsolved after Month of Investigation Approximately one month ago on the 24th of April, local grocer John McFarmer was found dead in his apartment complex at the corner of 13th and Main street. According to the police report, he died of blood loss from multiple stab wounds to his abdomen. Investigators found few signs of struggle and no indication of a break in, leading them to suspect that McFarmer most likely knew the perpetrator and let them into his home himself. Although police have looked into close contacts of McFarmer, they have yet to find any prime suspects due to an unfortunate lack of physical evidence at the crime scene. Mohave police have yet to comment on the likelihood that this case is linked to the Red County murders last November or the disappearance of the Landell family in March. If you or anyone you know have any information regarding the McFarmer case, the Mohave police department implores you to please come forward.
